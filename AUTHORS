The NACCulator project would not have been possible without the help and
support of:

 * the Clinical and Translational Science Informatics and Technology team at
   the University of Florida [http://ufl.to/ctsit];
 * our 1FL partners at Mount Sinai Medical Center, the University of Miami,
   Florida Atlantic University, and Florida International University;
 * the technical team at the University of Kansas Medical Center
   [http://kumc.edu];
 * the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center at the University of
   Washington [https://www.alz.washington.edu];
 * and the National Institute of Aging.

Mr. Rapczak would especially like to thank Kevin S. Hanson <kshanson@ufl.edu>
and Christopher P. Barnes <cpb@ufl.edu> for their direction and support.
