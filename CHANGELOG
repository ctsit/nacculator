## [1.10.0] - 2022-08-31
### Summary
This release introduces minor fixes to the FTLD and LBD Short Version modules.

### Added
 * Add missing field for #3 in LBD Short Version FVP form E2L in the builder file (Samantha Emerson)
 * Add ability to run filters on a local redcap export csv rather than automatically downloading via redcap api (Samantha Emerson)

## [1.9.0] - 2022-06-24

### Summary
This release changes our REDCap API call from cappy to PyCap, which allows for
a more flexible data export. This new library makes it so a REDCap project of
any size can be automatically exported; the filters will no longer fail when
attempting to export a REDCap data csv larger than 30mb.

### Updated
 * Update run_filters.py to use PyCap instead of cappy
## [1.8.2] - 2022-04-26

### Summary
This release fixes another bug in the FTLD blanking logic parsing that caused
an error for rules that contained both a multi-part question and a comma
(i.e. "Question 3b,").

### Updated
 * Fix regular expression parsing for blanking rules in FTLD module to account for unusual punctuation in DED

## [1.8.1] - 2021-11-04
### Summary
This release provides one major bug fix in the FTLD follow-up packet, updated
installation instructions, and a few minor fixes for bugs in error logging
etc.

### Updated
 * Fix cappy install instructions in README
 * Update FTLD FVP Z1X with fixed column spacing


## [1.8.0] - 2021-09-13
### Summary

### Updated
 * Add Z1X processing to LBD short version
 * Update UDS Z1X to include handling for optional LBD short version fields
 * Make C2T optional for telephone follow-ups to reflect NACC's DED

### Added
 * Add new CV covid module


## [1.7.1] - 2021-02-03
### Summary
This release updates the telephone follow-up packet (TFP) module to include
all allowable values in the NACC data element dictionary (DED).

### Updated
* C2T and A3 allowable values in TFP version 3.2 forms.py


## [1.7.0] - 2021-01-15
### Summary
This release incorporates the telephone followup packet 3.2 module which
includes the C2T form. Centers will be able to process data from forms like
the T1 and C2T, along with the expanded telehealth regimen in the other
forms provided by NACC due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Added
 * Unit tests for TFP module functionality
 * Re-add skipping logic to TFP form a3 from the updated DED for TFP
 * Added the tele_ prefix to drug id filter for form A4

## [1.6.0] - 2020-12-15
### Summary
This change was implemented after getting feedback from OHSU. Some ADRCs do
not have the optional forms like A2 or A3 in their REDCap project at all, since
they will not be used for that center. NACCulator used to run with the
requirement that all forms be present in a REDCap project, whether they were
optional or not. This change is very similar to the one made previously that
made the CLS, Z1, and C1 forms optional for the REDCap csv input.
I also fixed a bug in the FTLD FVP builder that would cause it to look for the
IVP Z1X form.

### added
 * Make optional forms for FTLD optional in REDCap project
 * Make all optional UDS3 forms optional in REDCap project


### changed
* Fix cruft in FVP builder (Samantha Emerson)
* Update README to account for cappy install complication
* Fix ftld fvp builder to take followup Z1X instead of initial

## [1.5.0] - 2020-12-08
### Summary

This version introduces several smaller maintenance-level updates.
The FTLD builder files now function similar to the UDS3 module builders,
where NACCulator will first scan the Z1X to see which forms are present
in the record rather than automatically trying to process all possible
forms. This will prevent users from having to repeatedly manually delete
empty optional forms that will never be filled out.

NACCulator's event detection has been generalized to be more compatible
with more centers. The requirement for the initial visit packet's event
name to contain "initial_visit" has been changed to "initial", and the
requirement for the followup visit packet's event event name to contain
"followup_visit" has been changed to just "follow" (to account for variants
with either "followup" OR "follow_up").

The README has been updated to include more information about what data
NACCulator needs from REDCap in order to run correctly (such as the filled
Z1X form), and updated documentation on running the filters. I corrected the
example commands for running the individual filters (with an input csv AND an
output csv) so that they work properly now. All filter commands now require an
argument specifying the config file so that the "validate" function in
filters.py works properly. This makes the command structure consistent across
all filters.

### added
 * Add note about Z1X to README
 * Add optional form logic to fvp builder
 * Add optional form logic to ftld ivp builder

### changed
 * Fix typo in README
 * Edit NACCulator capitalization to be consistent within README
 * Update documentation on filters and adjust example config file to make it easier to comment/uncomment filters
 * Fixed typo fukid9agd and fusib17pdx to have underscores in uds fvp builder
 * Update compatible redcap_event_names to be more general (initial, follow)

## [1.4.0] - 2020-10-21
### Summary
